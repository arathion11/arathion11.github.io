    <!-- THEME-->

    <!--For this assignment, I decided to show the different things I did
    over the summer when I took a 7 day cruise to Alaska>. I chose to go with
    blue and grey colors to mimic the scenery of alaksa, and the theme includes
    pictures of the attractions I saw, how to book a similar cruise, and what I ate
    on the ship. I framed the photos to make it look more like a scrapbook,
    and I chose the font to mimic the old typewriter font that ships used to 
    send messages.-->

        <p id="first-paragraph"> Over the summer, I went on a cruise to Alaska with my family.
            We went on various excursions and got to see a lot of the beautiful 
            scenery. It was an incredible experience that I want to 
            share with you guys.
        <p>
            On my excursions I saw orcas, glaciers, large valleys, and even 
            boarded an open train.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ship had the most amazing food- I wrote down all the dishes I ate
            to both remember them and hopefully encourage you guys to try some out.
        </p>

        <p>
            I would love to get to know you guys and keep in touch!
        </p>

        <p> 
            If you want to book your own cruise, I have provided the links and information
            to Celebrity Cruises, which is the company that I travelled with.
